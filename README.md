# py5canvas examples
This repository contains example sketches for [py5canvas](https://github.com/colormotor/py5canvas). 

Note that the code and this document are mostly adapted from the examples of [p5py](https://p5py.github.io/), with some additions/ modifications. The 3d examples have been removed, as py5canvas is currently focused on 2d graphics.

Examples are sorted in folders as
follows:

- `basics` -- ported examples from "Basic" Processing examples.
- `reference` -- sketches that show use of a particular p5 feature.
- `misc` -- a collection of complete sketches that use p5.
- `other` -- Py5canvas specific examples with some functionalities such as GUI and parameters.

Please use the Issues tab to report issues and/or make requests for
examples.

If you are using the latest developmental version of p5, please use
the examples from the `develop` branch.
