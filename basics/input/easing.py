# MOve the mouse across the screen and the symbol will follow. Between
# drawing each frame of the animation, the program calculated the
# difference between the position of the symbol and the cursor. If the
# distance is larger than 1 pixel, the symbol moves part of the
# distance (0.05) from its current position toward the cursor.
