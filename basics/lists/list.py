# List
#
# A list is a data type in Python that can be used to group together
# other values. Lists might contain values of different types but
# usually the items have the same type. Each piece of data in a list
# is identified by an index number representing its position in the
# list. Lists are zero based, which means that the first element in
# the array is [0], the second element is [1], and so on. In this
# example, a list named "coswav" is created and filled with the cosine
# values. This data is displayed three separate ways on the screen.
