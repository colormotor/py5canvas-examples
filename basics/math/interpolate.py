# Linear Interpolation.
#
# Move the mouse across the screen and the symbol will follow. Between
# drawing each frame of the animation, the ellipse moves part of the
# distance (0.05) from its current position toward the cursor using
# the lerp() function
#
# This is the same as the Easing under input only with lerp() instead.
