# Remap
#
# Use the remap() function to take any number and scale it to a new
# number that is more useful for the project that you are working on.
# For example, use the numbers from the mouse position to control the
# size or color of a shape. In this example, the mouse's x-co√∂rdinate
# (numbers between 0 and 360) are scaled to new numbers to define the
# color and size of a circle.
